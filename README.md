## How the app works  

* This project uses Ruby on Rails. If you do not already have Ruby installed, you can do so here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

* Once you have Ruby installed, you can fork and then clone down this repo to your local device. 
   * In your terminal you will need to run: 
        * `bundle install` 
        * `rails db:migrate`
        * `rails db: seed`
        * `rails s (runs your server)` 
        
* Once you have your backend server running, you can go into the frontend repo which you can view at: https://github.com/miwhag/ultimate-frontend,  and follow the instructions there.
