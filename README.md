## How the app works  

* To run the app, first fork and clone down this repo to your local device. 
   * In your terminal you will need to type: 
        * bundle install 
        * rails db:migrate 
        * rails db: seed
        * rails s (runs your server) 
        
* Once you have your backend server running, you can go into the frontend repo which you can view at: https://github.com/miwhag/ultimate-frontend,  and follow the instructions there.
